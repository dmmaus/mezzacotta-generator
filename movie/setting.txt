, according to prophecy
, all filmed in a single take
, allegedly
, and it went better than expected
, and things only get worse
, and things will never be the same
, as foretold by the ancient ones
, but it all goes horribly wrong
, but it was all a dream
, but things spiral out of control
, in a very special movie event
, inspired by actual events
, or not
, or so it may seem
, or so it seems
, or so we are led to believe
, or something
, or whatever
, presented in the form of an interpretive dance
, suddenly
, to the sound of $noun-instrument-musical_S
, with a $movie/character
, with a surprising outcome
, with an ending nobody will see coming
, with deadly consequences
, with hilarious results
, with tragic results
, basically
. And that's just the first scene
# . But suddenly, ~~movie
# . But then, ~~movie
# . Eventually, ~~movie
# . Later, ~~movie
. Not
. Or maybe they didn't
. The $noun-animal dies
. Then, ~~movie
. Then, in a ~$artifact/adj-artifact development, ~~movie
. And so much more
. Will they all die in the end?
. How will it all end?
. Will a $movie/character come along and save the day?
. Will they find $artifact/base ?
. One of them turns out to be $adj-person all along
. It turns out that they were in $place all along
. You'll never believe who their $person-relation is!
. You'll never believe what their $person-relation_S do next!
. You'll never believe who $verb-transitive_S them in the end!
. The moral of the story is never $verb-transitive your $noun_S
. The moral of the story is always $verb-transitive your $noun
. They all learn to never $verb-transitive a $movie/person
. They all learn to always $verb-transitive their $person-relation_S
. They all vow to never let anyone $verb-transitive them in $place again
. The moral of the story is to never be $adj-person when in a $noun-geography-landform
. If only they weren't so $adj-person !
. If only they had the $artifact/base !
. And then, there's what happens to their $person-relation_S ..
, based on the extraordinary true story of $place 's most famous $movie/person
, and only $artifact/base can save them
, and only a $movie/character can put things right
, only to find out that one of them was really a $movie/person
... or did they?
