# Adjectives
# Broken into several subcategories as listed below.
#
# When stacked in front of a noun, adjectives in English usually follow the following order:
# [Copied from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective#Order]
#
# 1. Determiners and postdeterminers – articles, numerals and other limiters (e.g. three blind mice)
# 2. Observation/opinion – limiter adjectives (e.g. a real hero, a perfect idiot) and adjectives subject to subjective measure (e.g. beautiful, interesting), or with a value (e.g. good, bad, costly)
# 3. Size – adjectives denoting physical size (e.g. tiny, big, extensive)
# 4. Age – adjectives denoting age (e.g., young, old, new, ancient, six-year-old)
# 5. Shape – adjectives describing more detailed physical attributes than overall size (e.g. round, sharp, swollen)
# 6. Colour – adjectives denoting colour (e.g. white, black, pale)
# 7. Origin – denominal adjectives denoting source (e.g. French, volcanic, extraterrestrial)
# 8. Material – denominal adjectives denoting what something is made of (e.g., woollen, metallic, wooden)
# 9. Qualifier/purpose – final limiter, which sometimes forms part of the (compound) noun (e.g., rocking chair, hunting cabin, passenger car, book cover)
